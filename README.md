Utilized Python programming language and the Qiskit library to construct and fine-tune quantum kernels for Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification tasks. Employed Optuna for efficient hyperparameter search, showcasing proficiency in algorithm optimization. Successfully evaluated model performance through rigorous cross-validation techniques and achieved competitive accuracy rates on test datasets. Collaborated with mentors to refine techniques and continuously enhance knowledge in Quantum Machine Learning.
